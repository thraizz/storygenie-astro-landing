    <h3 class="question">How does Storygenie work?</h3>
    <p class="answer">
      Storygenie utilizes cutting-edge machine learning technology, specifically
      a fine-tuned GPT-4 model, to generate detailed user stories based on
      provided project context and requirements. These stories can then be
      edited collaboratively and exported to your issue tracker, saving time and
      effort for teams.

    <h3 class="question">
      Whatâ€™s the difference between Storygenie and generating stories with
      ChatGPT?
    </h3>
    <p class="answer">
      There are many differences! ChatGPT is a chatbot that generates a story
      for you, while Storygenie is a platform for writing and improving stories.<br
      />You can generate, edit, collaborate and export stories - all within
      Storygenie. Beyond that, our used large language model has been trained
      specifically to generate the best scrum stories, so Storygenie outperforms
      ChatGPT in this specific task, even when using GPT-4.
